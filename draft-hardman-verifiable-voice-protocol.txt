             draft-hardman-verifiable-voice-protocol-latest

Abstract

   Verifiable Voice Protocol (VVP) proves the identity and authorization
   of parties who are accountable for telephone calls, eliminating trust
   gaps that scammers exploit.  VVP aims at roughly the same target as
   STIR ([I-D.ietf-stir-passport-rcd]), SHAKEN ([ATIS-1000074]), RCD
   ([I-D.ietf-stir-passport-rcd], [I-D.ietf-sipcore-callinfo-rcd]), and
   related technologies.  Like these approaches, it binds strong
   cryptographic evidence to headers in the SIP [RFC3261] INVITE that
   initiates a phone call, and allows this evidence to be verified
   downstream.  However, VVP builds from different technical and
   governance assumptions, and the nature of its evidence is different.
   This foundation makes VVP simpler, more decentralized and cross-
   jurisdictional, cheaper to deploy and maintain, more private, more
   scalable, and higher assurance than alternatives.  It can be used by
   itself, or as a lightweight supplement to bridge gaps in these
   alternatives.

1.  Introduction

   When we get phone calls, we want to know who's calling, and why.  If
   we could answer such questions with confidence, we would make
   reasonable judgments about whether to answer, based on the
   relationship and reputation context.

   Unfortunately, providing quality answers is much harder than it
   seems.  Scammers love to impersonate, and they succeed more often
   than we'd like.

   Regulators are mandating increased transparency to address this risk.
   This is wise, and it can be effective.  However, it introduces some
   heavy burdens.  Reliably vetting the identity of every possible
   caller is an ambitious task.  Maintaining a comprehensive, up-to-date
   graph of certificates and cryptographic keys to attest vetted
   identities is harder.  Operating a central registry of such
   identities and evidence, especially as phone calls increasingly cross
   jurisdictional boundaries, is harder still.  Regulatory constraints
   on data movement, shifting technical standards, variety in PSTNs and
   system interconnects, and many other factors further complexify.

   However, the inherent limit in today's transparency efforts is more
   fundamental: there exists a pernicious gap between the party
   accountable for a phone call, and the party that provides evidence
   about who's calling.  A decade ago, the TSP told us who's calling in
   a probabilistic way, based on unreliable metadata about a call's
   source.  More recently, approaches like STIR/SHAKEN move the evidence
   source closer to the origin, and add tamper protections.  However,
   there is still a gap: the signer of a SHAKEN passport is the OSP, not
   the caller, and the OSP may not know what's happening in this gap.  A
   high percentage of STIR/SHAKEN traffic does not receive an A
   attestation, and even the traffic that does receive it may receive it
   on imperfect evidence.

   In theory, the remaining gap could be eliminated by requiring a
   perfect authentication and authorization between callers and OSPs,
   for every phone call -- simply refuse to connect calls that do not
   match an ideal profile for trust.  However, this is impractical for
   many legitimate business reasons.  To cite one obvious example,
   Organization X might hire Call Center Y to call on their behalf,
   using X's reputation/brand and X's phone number.  In such a
   situation, X is the relevant answer to the "who's calling" question,
   but Y is the originator of the call -- and there's no good way to
   guarantee that everyone knows the existence and status of that
   relationship.  In addition, the market manifests a demand for
   wholesalers/aggregators of phone numbers, and is characterized by
   complex system layers and interconnects, that further challenge
   transparency.

   VVP solves these problems by applying two crucial innovations:

   *  It uses an evidence format called Authentic Chained Data Container
      (ACDC) -- [TOIP-ACDC].  The chaining feature in ACDCs is safer,
      more powerful, and easier to maintain than the one in X509
      certificates ([RFC5280]).  It is also capable of modeling nuanced
      delegated relationships such as the one between Organization X and
      Call Center Y.  This eliminates the gap between accountable party
      and caller, while maintaining perfect transparency.  Y can sign a
      call on behalf of X, using a number allocated to X, and using X's
      brand, without impersonating X, and they can prove to any OSP or
      any other party, in any jurisdiction, that they have the right to
      do so.  The evidence that Y cites can be built and maintained by X
      and Y and does not need to be published in a central registry.
      Further, when such evidence is filtered through suballocations or
      crosses jurisdictional boundaries, it can be reused, or linked and
      transformed, without altering its robustness or efficiency.  ACDCs
      verify data back to a root through arbitrarily long and complex
      chains of issuers, whereas formats like W3C Verifiable Credentials
      ([W3C.REC-vc-data-model-20220303]) and SD-JWTs
      ([I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt]) require direct trust
      in the proximate issuer.  This means ACDCs are lossless in
      delegation, not lossy, and flexible, not fragile.  The result is
      that no third party has to guess who's accountable; the
      accountable party is transparently and provably accountable,
      period.  Notwithstanding this transparency, ACDCs support a form
      of pseudonymity and graduated disclosure that satisfies vital
      privacy and data processing constraints.

   *  Although VVP can work inside governance frameworks such as SHAKEN
      [ATIS-1000074], it dramatically upgrades at least one key
      ingredient: the foundational vetting mechanism.  The ACDC format
      used by VVP is also the format used by the Verifiable Legal Entity
      Identifier (vLEI) standardized in [ISO-17442-3]. vLEIs use a KYC
      approach established by the Regulatory Oversight Committee of the
      G20, based on the LEI ([ISO-17442-1]) that's globally required in
      cross-border banking.  This means the basis of vLEI trust is
      already adopted, and it is not limited to any particular
      jurisdiction or to telecom.  VVP offers two-way, easy bridges
      between identity in phone calls and identity in financial, legal,
      technical, logistic, regulatory, web, email, and social media
      contexts.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Overview

   Verifiable Voice Protocol depends on three interrelated activities:

   *  Curating evidence

   *  Citing evidence

   *  Checking evidence

   Citing and checking evidence occur in realtime during phone calls,
   and are therefore the heart of VVP.  However, curated evidence must
   exist before it can be cited; curating is an ongoing, parallel
   activity as phone calls occur; and citing and checking must react
   properly to changes in evidence.  Further, existing approaches have
   trust gaps precisely because they impose too few requirements on the
   evidence that backs their ecosystems.  Therefore, this specification
   includes normative statements about the nature of evidence and the
   processes that create and maintain it.

   Before we explain the evidence, however, we must define some roles.

3.1.  Roles

   An Allocation Holder (AH) is a party that controls how a telephone
   number is used, in the eyes of a regulator.  Typically, range holders
   are AHs, and so are the direct telephone number users (TNUs).  TNUs
   are customers of range holders -- enterprises and consumers.  Range
   holders are service providers; although they are AHs, they may not be
   TNUs for all the phone numbers in their allocated ranges.  It is
   possible for an ecosystem to include other parties as AHs (e.g.,
   wholesalers, aggregators).  However, some regulators dislike this
   outcome, and prefer that such parties broker allocations without
   actually holding them as intermediaries.

   For a given phone call, the Terminating Party (TP) is the party that
   receives the call.  The direct service provider of the TP is the
   Terminating Service Provider (TSP).

   The Originating Party (OP) is the caller.  The direct service
   provider of the OP is the Originating Service Provider (OSP).  For a
   given phone call, there may be many layers, boundaries, and
   transitions between OSP and TSP.

   Accountable Parties (AP) are organizations or individuals who hold
   the right to use a telephone number (RTU) in the eyes of a regulator.
   APs MAY be OPs, but this relationship does not always hold.  A
   business can hire a call center, and delegate to the call center the
   right to use its phone number.  In such a case, the business is the
   AP, but the call center is the OP.

   Verifiers (V) are parties that want to know who's calling, and why,
   and that evaluate the answers to these questions by examining formal
   evidence.  TPs, TSPs, OSPs, government regulators, law enforcement
   doing lawful intercept, auditors, and even APs or OPs can be
   verifiers.  Each may need to see different views of the evidence
   about a particular phone call, and it may be impossible to comply
   with various regulations unless these views are kept distinct -- yet
   each wants similar and compatible assurance.  The verifier role in
   VVP does not just check the validity of cryptographic evidence; it
   also considers how that evidence matches business rules and external
   conditions.  For example, a verfier may do more than decide whether
   Call Center Y has the right to make calls on behalf of Organization
   X; it may decide whether Y has this right at a particular time of
   day, when calling into a particular jurisdiction, for a particular
   business purpose.

3.2.  Evidence

3.2.1.  General categories

   The term "credential" has a fuzzy meaning in casual conversation.
   However, understanding how evidence is built from credentials in VVP
   requires considerably more precision.  We will start from lower-level
   concepts.

3.2.1.1.  SAID

   A self-addressing identifier (SAID) is the hash of a JSON object,
   encoded in CESR format ([TOIP-CESR]).  The raw bytes from the digest
   function are left-padded to nearest 24-bit boundary, transformed to
   base64url ([RFC4648]), and prefixed with a character that tells which
   digest function was used.  SAIDs are evidence that hashed data has
   not changed.  They can also function like a reference, hyperlink, or
   placeholder for the data that was hashed to produce them, though they
   are more similar to URNs than to URLs ([RFC3986]), since they contain
   no location information.

3.2.1.2.  Signature

   A digital signature over arbitrary data D constitutes evidence that
   the signer processed D with a signing function that took D and the
   signer's private key as inputs.  The evidence can be verified by
   checking that the signature is associated with the public key of the
   signer.  Assuming that the signer has not lost unique control of the
   private key, and that cryptography is appropriately strong, we are
   justified in the belief that the signer must have taken deliberate
   action that required seeing an unmodified D in its entirety.

3.2.1.3.  AID

   An autonomic identifier (AID) is a short string that can be resolved
   to one or more cryptographic keys at a specific version of their key
   state.  AIDs are like W3C DIDs ([W3C.REC-did-core-20220719]}, and can
   be transformed into DIDs.  However, they possess several security
   properties that are not guaranteed by DIDs in general (self-
   certification, support for prerotation and multisig, support for
   witnesses, cooperative delegation, and so forth).  Using
   cryptographic keys, a party can prove it is the controller of an AID
   by creating digital signatures.

3.2.1.4.  Signatures over SAIDs

   Since neither a SAID value nor the data it hashes can be changed
   without breaking the correspondence between them, signing over a SAID
   is equivalent, in how it commits the signer to content and provides
   tamper evidence, to signing over the data that the SAID hashes.
   Since SAIDs can function as placeholders for JSON objects, a SAID can
   function as a placeholder for a JSON object in a larger data
   structure.  And since SAIDs can function as a reference without
   making a claim about location, it is possible to combine these
   properties to achieve some indirections in evidence that are crucial
   in privacy and regulatory compliance.  This is explored in greater
   detail below.

   VVP uses SAIDs and digital signatures as primitive forms of evidence.

3.2.1.5.  X509 certificates

   VVP does not depend on X509 certificates ([RFC5280]) for any of its
   evidence.  (However, if deployed in a hybrid mode, it MAY be used
   beside alternative mechanisms that are certificate-based.  In such
   cases, self-signed certificates that never expire might suffice to
   tick certificate boxes, while drastically simplifying the burden of
   maintaining accurate, unexpired, unrevoked views of authorizations
   and reflecting that knowledge in certificates.  This is because deep
   authorization analysis flows through VVP's more rich and flexible
   evidence chain.)

3.2.1.6.  ACDCs

   Besides digital signatures and SAIDs, VVP's other evidence uses the
   ACDC format ([TOIP-ACDC]).  This is normalized, serialized data with
   an associated digital signature.  Unlike X509 certificates, ACDCs are
   bound directly to AIDs, not to public keys.  This indirection has a
   radical effect on the lifecycle of evidence, because keys can be
   rotated without invalidating ACDCs.  Unlike X509 certificates, JWTs
   ([RFC7519]), and W3C Verifiable Credentials
   ([W3C.REC-vc-data-model-20220303]), signatures over ACDC data are not
   _contained_ inside the ACDC; rather, they are _referenced by_ the
   ACDC and _anchored in_ a verifiable data structure called a Key Event
   Log or KEL ([TOIP-KERI]).  The KEL is somewhat like a blockchain.
   However, it specific to one AID only (the AID of the issuer of the
   ACDC) and thus is not centralized.  The KELs for two different AIDs
   need not (and typically do not) share any common storage or
   governance, and do not require coordination or administration.  KELs
   thus suffer none of the performance and governance problems of
   blockchains, and incur none of blockchain's difficulties with
   regulatory requirements like data locality or right to be forgotten.

   ACDCs can be freely converted between text and binary
   representations, and either type of representation can also be
   compacted or expanded to support nuanced disclosure goals.  An ACDC
   is also uniquely identified by its SAID, which means that a SAID can
   take the place of a full ACDC in certain data structures and
   processes.  None of these transformations invalidate the associated
   digital signatures, which means that any variant of a given ACDC is
   equivalently verifiable.

   The revocation of a given ACDC can be detected via the witnesses
   declared in its issuer's KEL.  Discovering, detecting, and reacting
   to such events can be very efficient.  Any number of aggregated views
   can be built on demand, for any subset of an ecosystem's evidence, by
   any party.  This requires no special authority or access, and does
   not create a central registry as a source of truth, since such views
   can be served by untrusted parties.  Further, different views of the
   evidence can contain or elide different fields of the evidence data,
   to address privacy, regulatory, and legal requirements.

   ACDCs are capable of holding more generic categories of data than
   just credentials.

3.2.1.7.  Verifiable data

   Cryptographically verifiable data (CVD) is data that's associated
   with a digital signature and a claim about who signed it.  When CVD
   is an assertion, we make the additional assumption that the signer
   intends whatever the data asserts, since they took an affirmative
   action to create non-repudiable evidence that they processed it.  CVD
   can be embodied in many formats, but in VVP, all instances of CVD are
   ACDCs.

3.2.1.8.  Credential

   A Credential is a special kind of CVD that asserts entitlements for
   its legitimate bearer -- _and only its bearer_. CVD that says
   Organization X exists with a particular ID number in government
   registers, and with a particular legal name, is not necessarily a
   credential.  In order to be a credential, it would have to be
   associated with an assertion that its legitimate bearer -- _and only
   its bearer_ -- is entitled to use the identity of Organization X.  If
   signed data merely enumerates properties without conferring
   privileges on a specific party, it is just CVD.  Many security gaps
   in existing solutions arise from conflating CVD and credentials.

3.2.1.9.  Bearer token

   VVP never uses bearer tokens, but we define them here to provide a
   contrast.  A bearer token is a credential that satisfies binding
   requirements by a trivial test of possession -- like a movie ticket,
   the first party that presents the artifact to a verifier gets the
   privilege.  Since Bearer Credentials can be stolen, this is risky.
   JWTs, session cookies, and other artifacts in familiar identity
   technologies are often bearer tokens, even if they carry digital
   signatures.  Although they can be protected to some degree by
   expiration dates and secure channels, these protections are
   imperfect.  For example, TLS channels can be terminated and recreated
   at multiple places between call origination and delivery.

3.2.1.10.  Targeted credential

   A targeted credential is CVD that identifies an issuee as the bearer,
   and that requires the issuee to prove their identity
   cryptographically (e.g., to produce a proper digital signature) in
   order to claim the associated privilege.  All credentials in VVP are
   targeted credentials.

3.2.1.11.  Justifying link

   A Justifying Link (JL) is a reference, inside of one CVD, to another
   CVD that justifies what the first CVD is asserting.  JLs can be SAIDs
   that identify other ACDCs.

3.2.2.  Specific evidence

   With this background, we can now say that VVP depends on the
   following types of evidence:

3.2.2.1.  Message-specific signature

   Each voice call begins with a SIP INVITE, and in VVP, each SIP INVITE
   MUST contain a message-specific digital signature from the OP.  This
   signature MUST be the result of running a signing function over input
   data that consists of the following metadata about a call: the source
   phone number, an identifier for the AP, a timestamp, and a reference
   to Accountable Party Evidence (APE).  APE consists of several
   credentials, detailed below.  It MUST include a vetting credential
   for the AP.  If the source telephone number is allocated to the AP
   (which is true unless a proxy is the OP and uses their own telephone
   number), it MUST include a TNAlloc credential for the AP.  If the AP
   intends to contextualize the call with a brand, it MUST include a
   brand credential for the AP.  If there is a nuanced relationship
   between the AP as a legal entity and the AP in some limited
   manifestation, it MUST also include a delegation credential that
   nuances the relationship.  For example, this could distinguish
   between Acme Corporation, and software operated by Acme's IT
   department for the express purpose of signing voice traffic.  The
   former has a vetting credential and legal accountability, and can act
   as the company in all contexts; the latter can only sign voice calls
   on Acme's behalf.

If the OP and the AP are the same party, the digital signature and the relationship between AIDs in issuer and issuee roles in the evidence MUST bind the AP to the APE. Otherwise, the input data for the signature MUST also include an additional AID for the OP, plus a reference to Delegation Evidence (DE). The DE MUST include a vetting credential for the OP. If the OP is using a phone number allocated to the AP, the DE also MUST include a TNAlloc credential issued by the AP to the OP, delegating the right to use the AP's phone number. If the APE includes a brand credential, then the DE MUST also include a brand proxy credential, proving that the OP not only can use the AP's allocated telephone number, but has AP's permission to project the AP's brand while doing so.

It is crucial that this message-specific signature come from the OP, not the OSP or any other party. The OP can generate this signature in its on-prem or cloud PBX, using keys that it controls. It is also crucial that the distinction between OP and AP be transparent, with the relationship proved by strong evidence that the AP can create or revoke easily, in a self-service manner. Verifiers that are capable of understanding delegations It is also vital that verification algorithms This allows  software, is crucial, and is different from alternative approaches. The fact that the the , that closes the attestation gap in existing approaches. Closing this gap is only practical because of the chaining and disclosure features of ACDCs.

3.2.2.2.  Vetting credential

   A vetting credential is a targeted credential that enumerates the
   formal and legal attributes of a unique legal entity.  It MUST
   include a legal identifier that makes the entity unique in its home
   jurisdiction, and it MUST include an AID for the legal entity.  This
   AID is unique globally.  It is called a vetting credential because it
   MUST be issued according to a documented vetting process that offers
   formal assurance that is is only issued with accurate information,
   and only to the AP it describes.  A vetting credential confers the
   privilege of acting with the associated legal identity if and only if
   the bearer can prove their identity as issuee via a digital
   signature.  A vetting credential MUST include a JL to a credential
   that qualifies the issuer as a party trusted to do vetting.  This
   linked credential that qualifies the issuer of the vetting credential
   MAY contain a JL that qualifies its own issuer, and such JLs MAY be
   repeated through as many layers as desired.  In VVP, the reference
   type of a vetting credential is an LE vLEI.  This implies both a
   schema and a governance framework.  Other vetting credential types
   are possible, but they MUST be true credentials that meet the
   normative requirements here.  They MUST NOT be bearer tokens.

3.2.2.3.  Brand credential

   A brand credential is a targeted credential that enumerates brand
   properties such as a brand name and a logo.  It MUST be issued to an
   AP as a legal entity, but it does not enumerate the formal and legal
   attributes of the AP; rather, it enumerates properties that would be
   meaningful to a TP who's deciding whether to take a phone call.  It
   confers on its issue the right to use the described brand.  This
   credential MUST be issued according to a documented brand research
   process that offers formal assurance that it is only issued with
   accurate information, and only to an AP that has the right to use the
   described brand.  A single AP MAY have multiple brand credentials
   (e.g., Coca Cola Holdings Germany, Gmbh holds a brand credential for
   Coke and for Sprite), and rights to use the same brand MAY be
   conferred to on multiple APs (Coca Cola Holdings Germany, Gmbh and
   Coca Cola Canada, Ltd may both possess brand credentials for Sprite).
   A brand credential MUST contain a JL to a vetting credential, that
   shows that the right to use the brand was evaluated only after using
   a vetting credential to prove the identity of the issuee.

3.2.2.4.  TNAlloc credential

   A TNAlloc credential is a targeted credential that confers on its
   issuee the right to control how one or more telephone numbers are
   used.  Regulators issue TNAlloc credentials to range holders, who
   issue them to TNUs.  TNUs often play the AP role in VVP.  If an AP
   delegates RTU to a proxy (e.g., an employee or call center), the AP
   MUST also issue a TNAlloc credential to the proxy, to confer the RTU.
   With each successive reallocation, the set of numbers in the new
   TNAlloc credential gets smaller.  Except for TNAlloc credentials
   issued by regulators, all TNAlloc credentials MUST contain a JL to a
   parent TNAlloc credential, having a bigger set of numbers that
   includes those in the current credential.  This JL in a child
   credential documents the fact that the child's issuer possessed an
   equal or broader RTU, from which the subset RTU in child credential
   derives.

3.2.2.5.  Brand proxy credential

   A brand proxy credential confers on an OP the right to project the
   brand of an AP when making phone calls, subject to a carefully
   selected set of constraints.  This is different from the simple RTU
   conferred by TNAlloc.  Without a brand proxy credential, a call
   center could make calls on behalf of an AP, using the AP's allocated
   phone number, but would be forced to do so under its own name or
   brand, because it lacks evidence that the AP intended anything
   different.  If an AP intends for phone calls to be made by a proxy,
   and wants the proxy to project the AP's brand, the AP MUST issue this
   credential.

3.3.  Curation

   The evidence that's available in today's telecom ecosystems resembles
   some of the evidence described above, in concept.  However, it has
   gaps, and its format is fragile.  Furthermore, if it is organized for
   discovery, it is typically assembled into large, centralized
   registries at a regional or national level.  These registries become
   a trusted third party, which defeats some of the purpose of creating
   decentralized and independently verifiable evidence in the first
   place.  Sharing such evidence across jurisdiction boundaries requires
   regulatory compatibility and bilateral agreements.  Sharing at scale
   is impractical at best, if not downright illegal.

   How evidence is issued, propagated, and reference is therefore an
   important concern for this specification.

   The job of vetting legal entities (which includes APs, but also OPs)
   and issuing vetting credentials is performed by a Legal Entity Vetter
   (LEV).  VVP places few requirements on such vetters, other than the
   ones already listed for vetting credentials themselves.  Vetting
   credentials do not need to expire, and in fact ACDCs and AIDs
   facilitate much longer lifecycles than certificates; prophylactic key
   rotation is recommended but creates no reason to rotate evidence.
   However, the LEV MUST agree to revoke vetting credentials in a timely
   manner if the legal status of an entity changes, or if data in a
   vetting credential becomes invalid.

   The job of analyzing the brand assets of a legal entity and issuing
   brand credentials is performed by a Brand Vetter (BV).  A BV MAY be
   an LEV, and MAY issue both types of credentials after a composite
   analysis.  However, the credentials themselves MUST NOT use a
   combined schema, the credentials MUST have independent lifecycles,
   and the assurances associated with each credential type MUST remain
   independent.  A BV MUST verify the canonical properties of a brand,
   but it MUST do more than this: it MUST issue the brand credential to
   the AID of an issuee that is also the issuee of a vetting credential
   that already exists, and it MUST verify that the legal entity in the
   vetting credential has a right to use the brand in question.  This
   link MUST NOT be based on mere weak evidence such as an observation
   that the legal entity's name and the brand name have some or all
   words in common, or the fact that a single person requested both
   credentials.  Further, the BV MUST agree to revoke brand credentials
   in a timely manner if the associated vetting credential is revoked,
   if the legal entity's right to use the brand changes, or if
   characteristics of the brand evolve.

   Regulators issue TNAlloc credentials to range holders, and range
   holders issue them to TNUs, and TNUs MAY issue them to a delegate.
   If aggregators or other intemediaries hold an RTU in the eyes of a
   regulator, then intermediate TNAlloc credentials MUST be created to
   track that RTU as part of the chain.  On the other hand, if TNUs
   acquire telephone numbers through aggregators, but regulators do not
   consider aggregators to hold allocations, then aggregators MUST work
   with range holders to assure that the appropriate TNAlloc credentials
   are issued to the TNUs.

   APs issue brand proxy credentials to OPs.

   Vetting and brand credentials may require large databases of metadata
   about organizations and brands, but how such systems work is out of
   scope.  Once credentials are issued, they are an independent source
   of truth.  No party has to return to the operators of such databases
   to validate anything.

   Issuance and revocation of all other credentials is self-service at
   every level, and does not require any large, centralized system.  The
   AIDs of issuers SHOULD be linked to witnesses

   APs issue
